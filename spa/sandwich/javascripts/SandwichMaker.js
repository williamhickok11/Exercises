// Create a sandwich order form that allows the user to select all the ingredients for a custom deli sandwich. Create a Sandwich module, then create the following as individual modules, using IIFE syntax, to augment Sandwich:



// Each IIFE should expose, in its public interface, a method named add{ingredient} (e.g. addMeat or addVeggies) that accepts a single argument. That argument's value should be the ingredient selected by the user.

// You should also create an additional JavaScript file that handles interacting with the form elements and determining which method should be called.

// Don't worry about exposing the prices to the user until you display the final cost. This is just an exercise, not a business model.

// Here's some simple boilerplate code to get you started.
